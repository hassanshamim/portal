**TODO**
- [ ] Add a `Portal.push_left/1` function that transfers the data in the other direction.  (Try and avoid code duplication between `push_left/1` and `push_right/1` )
- [ ] Learn more about ExUnit - write some tests! 
- [ ] generate HTML documentaiton for the project using ExDoc.
- [x] Push to Github
- [ ] Publish as a package using the Hex package manager
